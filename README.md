Pepevote is a democratized art curation platform. 

It uses Counterparty, a second layer of Bitcoin, 
to allow holders of assets in the RarePepe digital ecosystem to periodically vote on new additions to a curated digital art collection.

To run a PepeVote node, you currently need to be running a Bitcoin fullnode (and Counterparty federated node).
