PepeVote is a democratized digital art curation platform. 
<br>
<br>
1. Every week, artists submit digital art to the gallery
<br>
<br>
2. People in the Rare Pepe community vote on which art to accept
<br>
<br>
3. Two pieces of art are chosen each week
<br>
<br>
4. The first piece is chosen by weighted majority vote of owned Pepecash
<br>
<br>
5. The second piece is chosen by weighted majority vote of owned Pepe cards
<br>
<br>
6. After the week is over, art must be resubmitted to compete again
<br>
<br>
